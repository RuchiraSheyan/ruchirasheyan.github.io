        <p class="project-description">This was the first project I did at NIBM. I managed to learn Arduino from my
            friend and we made this security system. This was very exciting because this was my very first Arduino
            project. This was done as our C language project. This gave me much fun.

        <p class="project-description">This was our first year final project. This was an idea of my friend. This is an
            innovative product which wasn't available in Sri Lanka at the moment. We made the prototype of this air
            condition system successfully. We scored an A+ for this project.

        <p class="project-description">This was a project which I started improving the security system we made as our
            first year final project. I tried already available libraries and also started training my own neural
            network using Ubuntu as the operating system with Tensorflow and Keras.

        <p class="project-description">This was an assessment given to me when we were following the Information
            Security module. I had to make a hex dump displaying software for any given file input and it had to display
            the hex dump in the given format. This was a task which I enjoyed a lot with much challeges. We were allowed
            to use any language we want.
