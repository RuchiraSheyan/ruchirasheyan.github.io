                    Hello. Am Ruchira from Sri Lanka. I am a Software Engineer, technology enthusiast and a singer. I am
                    a person who like to learn new technologies and apply them to the work I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started studying software engineering at NIBM in 2017. I was mostly inspired by the artificial
                    intelligence applications I saw at that time. I started learning from the very basic at NIBM. Any
                    how after the very first few months, I started feeling sometimes what I was learning starting to
                    becoming boring to me. So I improvised and managed to learn more out of the scope of the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time I spent at NIBM was great. Some modules were bit boring and some were exciting. And also I
                    always had another challenge at that time which I had to manage. Anyhow I have spent a great time
                    there. I mostly liked the programming and logic related modules. During our first module which was
                    the C language I learnt Arduino from one of my friends who also was my mentor. And also the teacher
                    who tought us the C language did a great work helping to improve our programming skills. As that
                    module project I built a security system with Arduino. It brought much fun learning Arduino and also
                    working as a team learning new things. After we learned basic Java I learned about Spring Boot and
                    also about MQTT and mosquitto broker from my friend and used those for the Java module project. I
                    got to work with one of my favorite parts while I was making a prototype for a software competition
                    at NIBM. I started training a neural network using Tensorflow and Keras which was very popular at
                    the time. Learning new things and applying them always brought me fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After my second year I left out the course and started self studying and also doing freelance
                    software development work. I did get direct projects from clients and also I got work on Fiverr. But
                    I wasn't able to make a stable income. So I started working for software companies while also doing
                    self studies, learning what ever new I need and what ever I would like and was inspired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first company I started working for was my friends company. There we did work with the tool
                    called JHipster. The frontend was done with Angular and the backend with Spring Boot. And also we
                    used Elasticsearch and the database was MongoDB. After that I developed a system from a to z for the
                    company I worked next. By the time I did developing as a freelancer also. At the moment am working
                    as a software engineer at a company in Sri Lanka and also developing a mobile application to another
                    company. And also am doing other things which are also my hobbies. I sing as a bass singer in a
                    professional choir in Sri Lanka. I also like photography and videography, playing musical
                    instruments and learning new things.
