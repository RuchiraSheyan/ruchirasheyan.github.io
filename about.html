                    Hello. Am Ruchira from Sri Lanka. I am a Software Engineer, technology enthusiast
                    and a singer. I started studying software engineering at NIBM in 2017. I was mostly inspired by the
                    artificial intelligence applications I saw at that time. I started learning from the very basic at NIBM.
                    Any how after the very first few monsths, I started feeling sometimes what I learnt started becoming
                    boring to me. So I improvised and managed to learn more out of our scope of the course. After my second
                    year
                    I left out the course and started self studying and also doing freelance software development work. I
                    did get direct projects from clients and also I got work on Fiverr. But I wasn't able to make a stable
                    income. So I started working for software companies while also doing my self studies, learning what ever
                    new I need to do and what ever I would like or was inspired.</p>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Time I spent at NIBM was great. Some modules were bit boring and some were exciting. And also I always
                    had another challenge at that time which I had to manage.
                    Anyhow I have spent a great time there. I mostly liked the programming and logic related modules. During
                    our first module which was the C language I learnt Arduino
                    from one of my friends and also who was my mentor. And also the teach who tought us the C language did a
                    great job helping to improve our programming skills. For the module project I built a security system
                    width Arduino. It brought much fun learning Arduino and also working as a team learning new things.
                    After we learnd basic Java I learnd Spring Boot with the help of my friend and did the module project
                    with Spring Boot. And with the help of my friend I got the opportunity to use MQTT and Mostquitto broker
                    in my projects.
                </p>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    The first company I started working was my friends company. There we did work with the tool called
                    JHipster. The frontend was done with Angular and the backend with Spring Boot. And also we used
                    Elasticsearch and the database was MongoDB. Then I built a system for the next company I worked and
                    so on. At the moment am working as a software engineer at a company in Sri Lanka and also developing a
                    mobile application to another company. And also am doing another thing which is also my hobby, singing.
                    I do sing as a bass singer in a professional choir in Sri Lanka. I also like photography and
                    videography,
                    playing musical instruments, learning new things.
